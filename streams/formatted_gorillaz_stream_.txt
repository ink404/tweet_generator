Gorillaz have never really done it for me yet I check out their albums like i'm into them. not for me . the odd song here and there
Five songs into the new gorrilaz album and idk it sounds like gorillaz but it's odd for sure so far 6/10 gold noodle stars
Being honest, the new gorillaz album is so lifeless and repetitive. nothing on this album stands out. (except for submission')
Anthony hamilton + gorillaz: &lt;3
pelo amor, damon!
Album novo do gorillaz, cashmere cat, foster the people e da mary j. blige ficar triste pra que
The features on this gorillaz album,  dios mío
Per my last tweet, I had a polite disagreement with alexa this morning about whether there is a gorillaz album called humanz 😒
Gorillaz album humanz is a solid 10/10. wow.
Apparently this leaked some days ago. since i've been boned by fake gorillaz leaks before, I wanted to be safe this time lol.
There's a song on gorillaz new album "humanz" called sex murder party, and I think it's gonna be my favorite song off the album.
But, like I mentioned, the new gorillaz was patreon requested, so i'll try to have that review up instead.

cuq will prolly be next week.
The gorillaz album dropped today. i'm crazy excited 🤙🏽 #gorillaz #humanz

I missed the gorillaz ✨
3/ but what's getting to me is that (different sound aside) this doesn't feel canon with the rest of gorillaz.
"submission" from the new gorillaz album is teriffic. danny brown's aggressive verse fits in perfectly with the serene rest.
This new gorillaz album is lit 🔥🔥🔥
Let me out; gorillaz. what a tune.

I don't understand why people are saying that the new gorillaz album doesn't sound like gorillaz....they've never had one consistent sound
Unfortunately the new gorillaz album missed the mark for me. too many features, not enough damon albarn.
I've been listening to gorillaz for almost 20 years and they legit have not missed a step.
The gorillaz guest spots are like when mr. burns brought in a team of ringers to destroy homer's team, minus the bizarre accidents (i hope.)
In its entirety it didn't have that atmosphere i'm used to from gorillaz. highlights: ascension, shes my collar, let me out, andromeda

Well after two mental breakdowns and failing to take a nap, I am happy to announce I am finally listening to the new gorillaz album!!! :)
If someone tried to tell my that danny brown would be on a gorillaz album a few years ago, I would totally not believe it.
That new haim song is not good and this gorillaz album is very underwhelming
I'll be listening to the new gorillaz album and working on a poster/ invention concept for my classes. company would b nice bc-
I feel like this is an extension of plastic beach, tbh? each song w guest singers in it act as an extension to gorillaz' members themselves.
They've found the cure for depression it's humanz by gorillaz ^-^
Gorillaz new album on repeat 🤘
New gorillaz album all day folks
I've been listening to the gorillaz all day and I couldn't be happier
As much as i've come to expect sound-hopping from gorillaz, can't help but notice that this new record sounds a little... all over the place
"submission" ft. danny brown &amp; kelela still has a vibe that gorillaz incorporates via its tone and vocals.
Listened to the new gorillaz album this morning and i'm gonna listen to it again before I give my final verdict
Yeah this new gorillaz album is fire af
I was not emotionally ready for this gorillaz and vince staples song
2017 is already a fantastic year for my tastes in video games (zelda, persona), movies (logan, guardians), and music (gorillaz, paramore).
Im very happy for this new gorillaz album.
it's amazing
This kelela chick on the new gorillaz album kind of sounds like yukimi nagano.
Gorillaz humanz was an experience. I am a robot now 🤖
Damn gorillaz rlly ain come thru w this album like I thought
The new gorillaz album is so good everyone can fight me
I'm pretty sure this new gorillaz album is the soundtrack to the future
It just feels different since 2d/albarn isn't leading vocals in that song at all. tracks with 2d still feel gorillaz as ever.
Me: oh cool the gorillaz are coming to vegas.
me: at life is beautiful..? okay let's just see--
me: $655 good god no
Gorillaz albums take some time to adjust to, but my early impressions of #humanz is that it's... yeah, pretty bad

The gorillaz have saved my life. I need to see them in october.
I've got a lot of opinions today. gorillaz went in. mary j. blige went in.
Listening to new gorillaz at the moment. busted and blue is the only track that really feels like a gorillaz track so far.
Wow the gorillaz album gets better the more I listen, in context as an album its way better
By my previous post I simply mean I need two copies. which is perfectly reasonable for gorillaz.
People out here underrating the new gorillaz album like it's 2005.

The new #gorillaz album just sounds like a mix tape of rappers I don't know or care about.

Sincerely hope "out of body" will be the next music video from gorillaz. surreal dance/rap ritual handled with a valley-like cadence.

This new gorillaz album heat rock? whats the word on the street
I'll agree that "andromeda" ft. d.r.a.m. is the first song that feels 'purely' gorillaz, thanks to its combined beat &amp; 2d lead. it's good.
